How to write and execute Javascript Code
========================================
1. Browser (FrontEnd Devlopment)
   a. cretae a javascript file with some javascript content
   b. include that javascript file in to HTML file
      <script src="./addition.js"></script>
   c. open HTML file in browser (alt+b)

2. Nodejs  (BackEnd Development)
    a. cretae a javascript file with some javascript content
    b. run that javascript file with the below command
       node <filename>.js  (make sure nodejs is installed)

Note : Every javascript code that runs on browser, might not work in nodejs


What is the best place to add <script> tag , <head> / <body>
============================================================
-With HTML5, we got two new boolean attributes for the <script> tag : async and defer.
 ex:- <script src='demo.js' async/defer></script>
-async/defer attribute should only be used on external scripts, not with internal scripts.
-These attributes only make sense while using the script in the head portion of the page.
-async attribute ensures that the JavaScript file is loaded asynchronously in the background and does not block rendering.
-defer attribute tells the browser to run the script after the document has been parsed
-With async, the file gets downloaded asynchronously and then executed as soon as itâ€™s downloaded.
-With defer, the file gets downloaded asynchronously, but executed only when the document parsing is completed.
-With defer, scripts will execute in the same order as they are called. 
 defer is useful when a script depends on another script.
