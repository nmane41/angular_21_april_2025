How Javascript Works
====================
-When a javascript code is executed, N # of execution contexts are created.
-1 Global Execution context is created for every javascript program.
-For Each Function call 1 execution context is created.
-Execution context is the environment within which the current code is being executed.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Allocates memory - variables & functions and assign 'undefined' to variables)
	2. execution phase. (Code gets Executed - assign values to variables & method invocation)

  Variables
  ==========
  -variables in javascript are declared using the below 3 keywords:
  1. var   
  2. let
  3. const

  var						            let						          const

2.value can be changed   2.value can be changed       2.cann't be changed
3.initialization is		   3.initialization is		      3.mandatory
	not mandatory           not mandatory	
4.can be redeclared		   4.cann't be redeclared		    4.cann't be redeclared
5.function/global		     6.block/function/global	    6.block/function/global
6.TDZ - No			 	       5.TDZ - Yes				          5.TDZ - Yes

N:p - All variables (var,let,const) are hoisted but only 'var' variables are usable/reachable before initialization.
-let/const variables are not reachable/usable before initialization (Temporal Dead Zone)
